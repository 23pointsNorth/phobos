# Phobos Roadmap

We've decided to put the version number 0.5 on our first ever versioned release. This is due to the feeling that we're "halfway there".

## 0.5

| branch  | designated push date |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| next  | 10.10.2014  |
| stable | 13.10.2014  |

This is our first ever release and will support all basic editing functions. Some features are still missing, some features only work for special cases. This is to be viewed as a first beta version that will still need lots of bugfixing and changes based on user feedback.

## 0.6

| branch  | designated push date |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| next  | 29.10.2014  |
| stable | 31.10.2014  |

This release will have better support for sensors and controllers as well as allow for the import of MARS scene files.
