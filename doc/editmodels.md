## Sensors

Sensors are currently rudimentarily supported, allowing for legacy sensor types of the MARS scene format to be used. No sensor-related data is exported to URDF and there are hardly any pre-defined custom properties for the different sensor types. Thus it falls to the user to set the custom properties according to the requirements. These issues however are top of the list for future releases of Phobos.
