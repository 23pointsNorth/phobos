Operators
=========

*Operators* are constructs in Blender that can be called from the GUI, thus whenever you click a button or menu item, you execute an operator. Thus while you can use lots of Phobos' functions when scripting in Blender, most of the time you will work with the set of operators it provides.
The following is a list of the categories and subcategories of operators in Phobos. We apologize for missing information on the operators.
